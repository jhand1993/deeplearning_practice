# Deep Learning Practice Projects with PyTorch

Just a personal repository to keep track of some PyTorch practice implementations with a dash of unit testing practice.

## Project One: Binary Image Classifier

Logistics, three-layer perceptron, and custom ConvNet for binary image classification on Kaggle cat and dog image set.

## Project Two: Encoders with Images

Autoencoders and variational autoencoders on some test image sets. 

## Project Three: Encoders with Images

Fun with SegFormer and small, custom Transformer networks for detection and segmentation.

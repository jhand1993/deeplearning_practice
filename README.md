# Deep Learning Practice Projects with PyTorch

Just a personal repository to keep track of some PyTorch practice implementations with a dash of unit testing practice.

## Project One: Binary Image Classifier

Logistics, three-layer perceptron, and custom ConvNet for binary image classification on Kaggle cat and dog image set.

## Project Two: Transformers for Computer Vision

Fun with SegFormer and small, custom Transformer networks for detection and segmentation.
